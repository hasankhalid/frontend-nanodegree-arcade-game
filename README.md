##Description
The came developed in this project is a slight variant of the classic arcade game called Frogger.

##How to Play?
Just use the arrow keys for navigation and move across the map to the very top. For every collision with the enemy bug your position will be reset to your starting position and 5 points will be deducted from your total score but do not be disheartened, every time you reach the top 20 points will be added to your tally. You can move across all directions.

##Navigation and Movement
Up Arrow - Move upwards.
Down Arrow - Move Downwards.
Left Arrow - Move left.
Right Arrow - Move right.

##Game Installation
Just download the zip file and extract it. Run index.html via your browser and the game should function properly.

## Tools / Techniques
- Object-Oriented JavaScript
- constructor functions to create multiple Enemy instances
- prototypal inheritance
- HTML5 Canvas API
- resource loading via immediately-invoked function expressions (IIFE)

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.
